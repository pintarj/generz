## Status Disclaimer

Project is in very early development stage:
- it doesn't really work yet (there are whole unimplemented stages)
- there are design choices that have still to be taken
- there are no examples of how to use it

Despite this, **any** contribution is welcome.

## Installation

_Node.js v10+_ is required to install/run `generz`. You can check which version it's installed on your system (if any):

```shell
node --version
```

If it's not installed you can obtain _Node.js_ in different ways:
- using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) **[recommended]**
- directly download and install the binaries from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

Once `node` (and therefore `npm`) is installed on your system you can install `generz`:

```shell
npm install --global generz
```
